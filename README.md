## Recommendations:
- the student performs better at lower speeds, or when he takes ample time to finish the quiz. Taking ample time could be encouraged
The student performs better when there are a higher number of questions. The student might need to practice time management when attempting quizzes with a low question count.


## Furthur Analysis
Further analysis could be performed if the questions of the historically conducted quizzes and more could be acquired. This further analysis can include:
- Looking at what type of question the candidate makes a mistake. Analysing if the candidate makes this mistake again when reattempting this quiz, and Recommending these questions more frequently based on the results.
- A rank predictor system could be established if data from other students is present.
